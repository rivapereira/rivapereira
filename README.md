### Hi there  âœ¨

ðŸŒŸ Riva Pereira | Big Data Student @ University of Wollongong Dubai ðŸŒŸ

 I'm a Big Data student with a passion for extracting insights from data. I enjoy using Python and R for data analysis and wrangling, but my true strength lies in transforming data into compelling visualizations through tools like Power BI and Tableau. I've sharpened my skills through a 4-month internship at SAAIT, a data visualization company. 
 
 I've also completed machine learning models (available in my repositories) and volunteered on projects that further honed my skills.

 #### Currently Working on:
 
 Right now-? I'm working on dashboards to put on display and ML projects to fine-tune, code and create. Also looking forward to creating and documenting more work I've done in university projects and personal ones. Being a Data Analyst is a journey which I'm proud to keep trying on-!!


 #### Open to: 
 Collaborations, freelance projects, and data visualization challenges! Do let me know and hit me up for that-!!1
