### Hi there  ✨

🌟 Riva Pereira | Big Data Student @ University of Wollongong Dubai 🌟

 ✨ I'm a Big Data student with a passion for extracting insights from data. I enjoy using Python and R for data analysis and wrangling, but my true strength lies in transforming data into compelling visualizations through tools like Power BI and Tableau.

 ✨ I have had previous experience with Sahra Al Aman Information Technology for 4 months

 ✨ These are just my skills at the forefront paired with my initiative and the skills I learned during volunteering, I have completed models in ML before as seen in the repositories which I shall workshop more 
 clearly below and open a HuggingSpace.

 ✨ Right now-? I'm working on dashboards to put on display and ML projects to fine-tune, code and create. Also looking forward to creating and documenting more work I've done in university projects and personal ones. Being a Data Analyst is a journey which I'm proud to keep trying on-!!

 ✨ Open to: Collaborations, freelance projects, and data visualization challenges! Do let me know and hit me up for that-!!1
