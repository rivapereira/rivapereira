✨ Hi there! ✨
🌟 Riva Pereira | Big Data Student @ University of Wollongong Dubai | AI Residency Intern @ Decoding Datascience 🌟

I'm a passionate Big Data student with a focus on transforming complex datasets into actionable insights. I enjoy working with Python and R for data analysis and wrangling, and my strength lies in creating interactive visualizations using tools like Power BI and Tableau. My 4-month internship at SAAIT, a data visualization company, helped me sharpen my skills in designing and building meaningful dashboards.

Currently, I'm interning at Decoding Datascience as part of an AI Residency Program, where I’m deepening my knowledge in AI and machine learning while collaborating on cutting-edge projects.

I’ve also worked on a variety of machine learning models (check out my repos!) and have volunteered on data-driven projects to apply my skills in real-world contexts.

Currently working on:
At the moment, I’m focused on perfecting machine learning models and developing interactive dashboards. I’m also documenting my AI Residency journey and university projects.
